Codestyle
=========

Classes
-------

 - Classes begin with a capital letter
 - No methods except static/extensions are defined first in a class. An interface first defines the method.
 - References refer to an interface, except for XML-serialization and Enumeration

Interfaces
----------

 - Interfaces start with a capital `I`.
 - All methods are defined first on interface level.
 - Marker interfaces are encouraged.
